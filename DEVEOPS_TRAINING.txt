
Deveops onservation-

mocking up framework - used when front end is not connected to back end then how do we test?  we use mocking up framework.

> if we are right click and do run test suite(contains multiple test scripts) then its not deveops since we are manully triggering the automation code.
we should integrate with jenkins build so whenever developers run the build it automatically triggers the test suite and execute the test scripts.


advance level of Deveops- when we take care of data and do not need to pause the execution for updating the data in excel sheet i.e. when build is getting executed 

test data are also being taken care of.
